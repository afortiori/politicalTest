# 8values fork
I wanted to make my own politcial test so I cloned 8values. I will include documentation for how I did it below once I finish.

Steps:
1) Planning - write questions + ideologies
2) Implement questions + ideologies
3) Modify quiz page to include your axies - could be tricky 
4) Change text on instructions + index page 
5) Change results page so it works with your axies and ideologies - hardest step 
6) Make new icons 

Now you are done!
